# List of (dependent) ports that are minimally required to be
# checked out from SVN in order to get ${DOCPORTS} built and
# installed.  It should follow the dependency list in
# ports/textproc/docproj/Makefile as much as feasible.
#
# Note that they are <category>/<port> names relative to
# ${PORTSDIR}/../ .
#
# This list of ports should be checked with the output of :
# make all-depends-list | sed -e 's|^/usr/||' | sed -e 's|$| \\|'

# Get __FreeBSD_version
